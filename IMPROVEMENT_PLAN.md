Here's a comprehensive improvement plan for the IndiCab project based on the files and requirements:

Component Modernization & TypeScript Migration

Target Files:
src/components/BookingForm.tsx
src/components/VehicleCard.tsx
src/components/PaymentForm.tsx
src/components/ui/ (all components)
Steps:
Convert PropTypes to TypeScript interfaces
Add proper type annotations
Implement modern UI patterns:
Micro-interactions
Responsive layouts
Accessibility enhancements
Create Storybook stories with multiple states
API Rate Limiting Enhancement

Target Files:
src/middleware/auth.ts
src/services/ErrorService.ts
src/lib/utils.ts
Implementation:
Dynamic rate limiting based on:
User tier (free/premium)
Endpoint criticality
Server load monitoring
Add response headers with rate limit info
Implement graceful degradation
Error Handling System

Target Files:
src/services/ErrorService.ts
src/app/not-found.tsx
src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx (to be created)
Features:
Standardized error responses
Contextual error logging
User-friendly error pages
Retry mechanisms for recoverable errors
Documentation Completion

Target Files:
All component files
src/types/ (type definitions)
src/stories/ (Storybook documentation)
Implementation:
Comprehensive JSDoc for all components
Usage examples in Storybook
Architecture overview in COMPONENT_ORGANIZATION.md
API reference in BACKEND_DOCUMENTATION.md
Testing Strategy

Target Files:
vitest.config.ts
playwright.config.ts
Test files in tests/ directory
Implementation:
Unit tests for all components
Integration tests for critical flows
Visual regression testing
Accessibility audits
Storybook Implementation

Target Files:
.storybook/main.ts
.storybook/preview.ts
Component stories
Features:
Dark/light theme toggling
Viewport testing
Interaction testing
Documentation pages
UI/UX Modernization

Target Components:
Booking flow (BookingForm.tsx)
Vehicle display (VehicleCard.tsx)
Payment processing (PaymentForm.tsx)
Design Elements:
Modern color palette
Micro-interactions
Responsive layouts
Loading states
Empty states
Dependent Files to Review First

tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration)
next.config.mjs (Next.js configuration)
tailwind.config.js (styling system)
src/models/ (data models)
src/context/ (application state)
Implementation Phases

Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure):

Complete TypeScript migration
Set up testing framework
Implement error handling system
Phase 2 (Component Modernization):

Update Booking flow components
Refresh UI components
Implement Storybook documentation
Phase 3 (Optimization):

Performance enhancements
Accessibility improvements
Final testing and polish
Risk Mitigation

Backward compatibility checks
Gradual rollout strategy
Performance monitoring
User feedback channels
Would you like me to proceed with examining any of these specific files or implementing particular improvements first? I can start with either:

Reviewing the Storybook configuration files
Examining the BookingForm component for modernization
Setting up the error handling system
