# Codebase Analysis Plan

## Information Gathered
1. **Error Handling**:
   - The `ErrorService.ts` file provides a structured way to handle errors using the `AppError` class and `ErrorService` class.
   - Different error types are defined, and toast notifications are used for user feedback.

2. **Booking Model**:
   - The `Booking.ts` file defines the booking schema with fields for user, vehicle, dates, total amount, and payment status.
   - Validation is implemented to ensure the end date is after the start date.

3. **Business Travel Page**:
   - The `page.tsx` file outlines the UI for business travel solutions, including premium cars and corporate packages.
   - It uses React components and hooks to manage state and effects, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Plan
1. **Further Analysis**:
   - Review additional components and services related to booking and business travel to understand their interactions.
   - Investigate the `lib` and `components` directories for utility functions and UI components that support the main functionality.

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update or create documentation for the error handling strategy, booking model, and business travel UI components.
   - Ensure that all components are well-documented for future developers.

3. **Testing**:
   - Implement or enhance unit tests for the `ErrorService`, `Booking` model, and business travel components to ensure reliability and maintainability.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Analyze the performance of the business travel page and identify any areas for optimization, such as lazy loading images or optimizing component rendering.

## Dependent Files to be Edited
- Additional components in `src/components/` related to booking and business travel.
- Utility functions in `src/lib/` that support the application logic.

## Follow-up Steps
- Review the identified files and implement the necessary changes based on the analysis.
- Conduct a code review to ensure adherence to best practices and coding standards.
