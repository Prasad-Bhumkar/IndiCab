# Indicab Clone Reorganization Summary

This document describes the reorganization process that moved all Indicab-related files into the `indicab-clone` directory.

## Files Moved

### Components and Pages
- All legacy React components from `/src/components` moved to `/indicab-clone/src/legacy-components`
- All legacy React pages from `/src/pages` moved to `/indicab-clone/src/legacy-pages`
- Admin pages from `/src/pages/admin` moved to `/indicab-clone/src/legacy-pages/admin`
- Main React app file (`App.tsx`) moved to `/indicab-clone/src/legacy-pages`

### Styles
- All CSS files from `/src/styles` moved to `/indicab-clone/src/styles`
- Admin CSS files from `/src/styles/admin` moved to `/indicab-clone/src/styles/admin`

### Assets
- Driver images from `/public/assets/drivers` moved to `/indicab-clone/public/assets/drivers`
- City images from `/public/assets/cities` moved to `/indicab-clone/public/assets/cities`

### Scripts
- Utility shell scripts for downloading images moved to `/indicab-clone/src/`

### Documentation
- `MISSING_PAGES_SUMMARY.md` moved into the `indicab-clone` folder

## Configuration Updates
- Updated `package.json` to include the `react-router-dom` dependency from the original `/src/package.json`
- Updated `netlify.toml` with the same environment variables as the root configuration

## Organizational Structure

All files have been organized into a clear structure:
- Modern Next.js app files remain in their original locations
- Legacy components and pages are kept in dedicated directories for potential future integration
- Assets are organized in a logical hierarchy
- Styles are grouped together in their own directory

## Next Steps

This reorganization makes it easier to work with the Indicab clone project by having all required files in one place. The next steps might include:

1. Gradually migrating legacy components to modern Next.js components
2. Integrating the styles from the legacy CSS files into the Tailwind CSS system
3. Ensuring all assets are properly referenced in the code with updated paths
4. Refactoring any code that might reference files outside the project directory
